Tetris: Source is a Tetris iteration for SourceMod Entertainment System

It is fully compliant with the latest Tetris Guideline 
(http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline)

It features two game modes: Sprint and Duel. Sprint is a shorter version of the standard Tetris Sprint/Line race, and you need to clear 20 lines as fast a possible. Duel is a two player mode where clearing lines gives them to the opponent.
